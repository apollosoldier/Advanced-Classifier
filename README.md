# Advanced Classification Model 🚀
This project implements an advanced classification model using an ensemble of deep learning classifiers, self-supervised learning, data augmentation, and adaptive training strategies. The model is designed for image classification tasks, with a sample implementation using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

# 📦 Requirements
 - Python 3.7 or later
 - PyTorch 1.9 or later
 - torchvision 0.10 or later

# 📁 Components

- **advanced_classification_model.py** : Contains the AdvancedClassificationModel class, which implements the main model architecture, training, and prediction methods.


- **base_classifier.py**: Contains the BaseClassifier class, which defines the base classifier architecture used in the ensemble.
data_augmentation.py: Contains the DataAugmentation class, which defines data augmentation strategies for the input images.
self_supervised_learning.py: Contains the SelfSupervisedLearning class, which implements a self-supervised learning framework (e.g., SimCLR) for pretraining the base classifier.

- **ensemble_classifier.py**: Contains the EnsembleClassifier class, which trains an ensemble of classifiers using the base classifier architecture.

- **adaptive_training_strategy.py**: Contains the AdaptiveTrainingStrategy class, which defines adaptive training strategies for selecting the best approach during training.

- **main.py**: A sample script that demonstrates how to use the AdvancedClassificationModel for a simple image classification task using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

# 🚀 Usage
Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision
```

Run the main.py script to train and evaluate the advanced classification model on the CIFAR-10 dataset:
```bash
python main.py
```

Customize the model architecture, data augmentation strategies, self-supervised learning framework, and adaptive training strategies as needed for your specific classification task.

# 🔧 Customization

You may need to adjust the model architecture, data augmentation strategies, self-supervised learning framework, and adaptive training strategies depending on your specific requirements and dataset. Please refer to the respective class implementations and modify them as needed.
